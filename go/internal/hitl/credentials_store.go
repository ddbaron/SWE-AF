// Package hitl provides human-in-the-loop primitives for SWE-AF: the scout's
// scoped-credential store, ask-user forms, the hax REST client, and the
// approval wrapper. This file is the process-local, execution-scoped store for
// credentials the environment scout negotiates.
//
// Why a process-local map instead of BuildConfig or app.memory (verbatim from
// swe_af/hitl/credentials_store.py):
//
//   - BuildConfig is serialized through ToExecutionConfigDict() and passed to
//     execute() via app.Call. The control plane logs all app.Call input data,
//     which would persist the credentials.
//   - app.memory (scope=run) is synced to the control plane DB by design —
//     also persists.
//   - Filesystem under artifacts_dir is written to disk and archived.
//
// The scout's negotiation produces credentials that should *only* live in the
// agent process's memory for the duration of the build, then be cleared. A
// module-level map keyed by run ID is the simplest way to achieve that while
// keeping concurrent builds (which share the process) isolated.
//
// Security boundary:
//
//   - Values are never logged.
//   - Values are never written to disk.
//   - Values are not serialized through app.Call (use this store from inside
//     the receiving reasoner, not as a kwarg).
//   - The build()'s deferred cleanup MUST call ClearScopedCredentials — every
//     error path included.
